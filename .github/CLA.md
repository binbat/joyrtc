# JoyRTC Contributor License Agreement

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your past, present and future contributions submitted to JoyRTC. You should sign this agreement before submitting your first contribution. Except for the license granted herein to JoyRTC and recipients of software distributed by JoyRTC, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

2. Definitions. "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to JoyRTC for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by JoyRTC (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to JoyRTC or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, JoyRTC for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution".
